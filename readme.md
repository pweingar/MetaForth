MetaForth is an experimental cross-compiler for Forth and Forth-like languages. The intention of this project is to create a version of Forth (or something very like it) which can be recompiled for several target systems and implementation methods with a minimum of fuss. MetaForth itself is a Python script which provides a minimal Forth compiler. Several words with defined compile-time semantics are recognized, as are numeric literals. These are used to control the compilation of assembly code words and words written in Forth into an assembly language file that can then be assembled for the target system.

I do not currently plan to make this project into anything terribly serious. My original goal for it is to allow me to create a Forth system for each of the Foenix machines that I have, and to have those Forth implementations to be reasonably consistent in their language and behavior. I don't have a good track record actually finishing Forth interpreters, so I make no promises about finishing this.

Why am I setting up a Github repository for it? The code has reached a scale where stupid mistakes can really take a long time to correct. So it is time to get it into version control.
